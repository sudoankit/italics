### Cheese, grapes and a jug of wine.
---------------

In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson issued the first presidential proclamation honoring fathers, designating the third Sunday in June as Father's Day.

That third Sunday this year is today. June 19 2016.

_Roses._ I woke up and saw roses. Roses in my garden. White and red. 

_Birds._ I saw birds flying in the sky. Free. Honoring their liberation. 

_Mongoose._ I saw a chain of mongeese swiftly crossing the road, the little ones, tail to tail. Love and care.

_Ants._ I saw them working hard for their hill. For life. 

_Cats._ I saw a cat, majestic and calmly licking it’s paw.

Then, I saw my _father_. Drinking coffee. \\
Déjà vu hit me. 
My father was all of the thoughts that clouded my mind this morning while I was at the garden.

Our relation is different. Silent and powerful. Calm and free. Caring and discipline. We don’t hang out a lot. 
Our taste in movies is different.
Our taste in songs is different. 
Our taste in some routine life is different. 

But in a good way. 

My father is pure and powerful in his heart as the roses. He sees me as his bird as I’m let free to do anything. He is caring and loving in his own way which is different but as I told you, in a good way. He works hard like an ant, and though doesn’t spend much time with me, he is always present when I need him. He pivots my life when it goes astray. He is calm and very understanding and respects many ideas that I give around the dinner table. 

This journey of father and son is an unique one. It’s the slash of red grapes and the juice of emotions. It’s tenderly strong. He is the bright sunlight that shines in my gloomy mind. He silent, but strong. He is watching me, every step that I tread my weary path. The flowers bloom in my road are watered by him. 

He is my dark knight. \\
He is Batman. 

**Happy Fathers Day Dad!.**

I love him for being what he was, what he is and what he will be.

Oh boy, I would like to take him surfing some day, or maybe sit and talk with some cheese, grapes and a jug of wine?
