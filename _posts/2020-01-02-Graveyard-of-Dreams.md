I can hear your shrill sirens of your beating heart, \\
I can feel we drift far way, far apart. \\
I can feel your frail hands holding me together, \\
I can feel your love fading into a blur.

I know I let you down, \\
I know I raged while you were around. \\
I know I became a slave of the evil inside. \\
I know I couldn’t be beside.

I know I let our dreams die, \\
Die in the graveyard of dreams. \\
While I hold this Hennessy, cold, \\
Pouring on the grave of our dream.

I wish I could call you now, \\
Even though it’s 1 o’clock, I just want to say ciao. \\
I’m shattered from the ground, \\
I’m crying a stream, I’m getting drowned. \\
I wish I could hold you now, \\
Even though it’s 1 o’clock, I think of you and wow.

It’s the price I need to pay, \\
Every second I think of the day, \\
I met you, I loved you, I kissed you, \\
I was a monster, a ghost but you knew, \\
You gave me a chance but I blew, \\
Blew it apart, you left me with a heavy adieu.

I wish I could hold you now, \\
Even though it’s 1 o’clock, I think of you and wow.
