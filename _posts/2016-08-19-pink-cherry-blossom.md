I remember what I had seen.

_White drapes, white sarees, white sky._ I saw white everywhere. I had come to meet my sister after a long long time. Little did I know, that those whites weren't the peaceful ones, those whites were something that I feared all my life and continue to.

You know what's white also?                         

>_...the white packet of cigarettes._

The world had stopped for something she wasn't ready for. She hadn't done anything wrong. She just wanted to ease the pain. More and more she tried to ease, not knowing she was praying indirectly to ease herself too.                         

When they looked into her eyes, they were scared but still _warm_. Warm, comforting and helpful were her qualities which she left printed on her comrades.                       

From the smile that _won hearts_, _the personality that made men cry out_, _the charming glee of her sisterhood_, she had abandon all sang sadly to the monotonous tone of a _cigarette_ whistle.

It's said that death is peaceful and how correct it was! She couldn't take a puff and ease the pain nor I could _see the amber dull glow of the cigarette end dance in her iris._                         

_Pink cherry blossoms_ fell on her, at 5 centimetres per second. People who loved cried around her, talked is hushed tones, and uttered sermons.                         

The clouds hurried to cry too, and before I realised what had happened, rain wet me but lost to _my tears wetting my heart from inside_ for lay in front of me, was my sister is white. Everything else was grey. 
 
I stood and knelt beside her, thinking the colourful days. I gave her some flowers to smell which her body graced after the torture by the cigarettes.                         

_The rain, the atmosphere, the people, the soil, the soul, the life, her, me everything were stitched to make me think that this wouldn't be true if she had listened to me..._                         

_.....as a drop of water left her finger and fell down to water, a flower beneath, I left how I had come, but without a sister._                         

_and life wasn't same again_                         
                      
Life won't be the same again                         

And, believe me I know that feeling very well. When she died, life never become the same again                         

Good Night. Sweet dreams. Don't cry. 
                        
_Don't cry because of cigarettes._    
                     
The life you are living now won't be with you.

The food you order, the smiles you share with friends, the talk we do, the hawa wala place, the crushes you get on teachers, the emotions, the cry, the tears. Every single thing you love will be taken away by _just a cigarette._ 

:) Ankit.
