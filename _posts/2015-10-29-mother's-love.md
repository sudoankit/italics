**12:15 am** : 

It's midnight. \\
I am on Quora. As usual. \\
My mother comes to my room, and sits beside me. \\
This conversation starts. 

**Mom** : When will go to sleep? \\
**Me** : Just after a minute. \\
**Mom** : Really? \\
**Me** : Yes, don't worry, you go to sleep, I will sleep now. \\
**Mom** : Then,  go and brush now. \\
**Me** : Yes, I  will. \\
**Mom** : Let me sit here till you come back from brushing. \\
**Me** : I will go, please go and sleep. \\
**Mom** : No, I will wait till I see you asleep. \\
**Me** : Mom, I just figured I have to watch the new episode of Arrow.
I will be sleeping late, Mom. Around 1 am, so go and sleep. \\
**Mom** : When will you take care of yourself? Okay. Sleep before 1am. \\
**Me** : Yes, Mom definitely. 

She goes to her room. All lights are off of the house except mine. After brushing, I start watching Arrow. ( *only one episode as promised to my Mother.*) \\
It's almost 1 am. 

**1:45 am** :

Finish watching an episode of Arrow. As the suspense is unbearable,  I watch another episode of Arrow. 

**2:30 am** :
 
Finish watching another episode. (*Sorry for the lie, mom*) \\
**It's 2:30 am.** \\
My mother walks in, again. \\
Conversation follows. 

**Mom** : What time is it now! \\
**Me** : Err,... Umm. I don't know. \\
**Mom** : 2:30 am! You told me you will sleep before 1 am!!!. \\
**Me** : I'm hungry, mom. \\
**Mom**: I had told you to take one more roti. \\
**Me**(*thinking*) : I get it now \\
**Mom** : Wait, let me go and  heat milk. 

Goes to **heat milk at 2:30 am for me, after a tiring and hard day.** \\
Comes back with warm milk and some biscuits. :) 

I greedily eat while she pats me and advises me to sleep early and eat properly. \\
I goof and joke around. \\
**She** *laughs.* \\
I do, too. 

**She says** : "Always keep laughing irrespective you study, or do anything. I will be happy." 

**Me** (*internally tears forming, and loving her more.*) : Yes Mom, you too keep laughing, always. 

It's **3 am** in the morning. \\
I go to sleep and she goes too. \\
All lights are off. \\
It's dark.

**3:15 am** :

I am still awake, on my bed. \\
*Insomnia, perhaps.* I try to make those eyelids fall, but all effort goes in vain. \\
I start reading Quora. ;). 

**3:45 am** :

Suddenly, I hear her footsteps, for her feet wears those *pretty leg-ankle jewelry-chain*. \\
( I don't know what the word is, and I'm too lazy now to search it up).

I suddenly close my phone, face the screen down and play to be asleep. 

My mother enters my room. She checks if I'm sleeping. 

Covers my cold feet with the blanket. \\
Caresses my hair, kisses me on the forehead, and says good night. 

**It's 4 am.** 

I will probably wake up late, at **11 am**, but she **has to wake up at 7 am** for her work calls, which will, again be for me. 

She *slept only* after she checked if I slept. \\
She **stayed almost the whole night awake**, just for me. \\
Indian Moms are so awesome and amazing, isn't? 

*She loves me dearly. And...* \\
*And, such is mother's love.*

**4:15 am** :

I, totally amazed by a mother's love, keep thinking about hope and love that makes the world such a beautiful place. It doesn't matter where the hell we are, how old we are and how bad our situation is. \\
**Mother's love is always, always there for you.** \\
**You are still in the womb of her love.** \\
**Sacrifice is immense, and so is her tender, gentle and genuine love.** 

**I love you, mom.** 

**4:20 am** 

I start writing this on Quora. \\
;)
