        <title>Friends matter. A lot.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subterfuge.&lt;/strong&gt;
I was worried about it. That someone whom I know would warp my conscience and subterfuge with it. 
It ain’t now so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Believe.&lt;/strong&gt;
Bonding. Relations. The strong ones. The valiant sea that we sail. The mast that never breaks. The sails that fill their chests with pride. With you beside, I ain’t sinking anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Telepathy.&lt;/strong&gt;
A hocus in most eyes. A wonder in some. A dream. Connecting still being far. The humanely inhuman power to know about someone not with you. About the person you care. 
I thought it was a bluff as science wasn’t sure. 
I ain’t thinking that now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pain.&lt;/strong&gt;
A multidimensional entity. That can’t be shared. Which is harsh. From which you can’t run away. You are stuck. 
I was stoic. 
It ain’t so now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friendship.&lt;/strong&gt; 
A power from within the four chambered hearts. An emotion endless. A feeling of unity. The sunshine amidst the rain. 
I love it now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family.&lt;/strong&gt; 
Sharing is caring. Caring is family. Family is being a sister. Being a sister with you makes the world more beautiful. 
I’m so thankful for being with me as a sister.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subterfuge. Believe. Telepathy. Pain. Family.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They all are different notations when you have true friendship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When words can only tell so much. When the feels take over. The heart races into a calm. The rough tides meet the tranquil. The transient yet eternal fractals of life shawn the orgasms of chaste spasms. It is the sentient presence of the friend spirit that pacifies the Pacific. A true silence is born, potent with eternity itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure I know of this silence.
I am sure I have one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much for curing me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you being here.&lt;/p&gt;
