        <p><strong>Subterfuge.</strong>
I was worried about it. That someone whom I know would warp my conscience and subterfuge with it. 
It ain’t now so.</p>

<p><strong>Believe.</strong>
Bonding. Relations. The strong ones. The valiant sea that we sail. The mast that never breaks. The sails that fill their chests with pride. With you beside, I ain’t sinking anymore.</p>

<p><strong>Telepathy.</strong>
A hocus in most eyes. A wonder in some. A dream. Connecting still being far. The humanely inhuman power to know about someone not with you. About the person you care. 
I thought it was a bluff as science wasn’t sure. 
I ain’t thinking that now.</p>

<p><strong>Pain.</strong>
A multidimensional entity. That can’t be shared. Which is harsh. From which you can’t run away. You are stuck. 
I was stoic. 
It ain’t so now.</p>

<p><strong>Friendship.</strong> 
A power from within the four chambered hearts. An emotion endless. A feeling of unity. The sunshine amidst the rain. 
I love it now.</p>

<p><em>Subterfuge. Believe. Telepathy. Pain.</em></p>

<p>They all are different notations when you have true friendship.</p>

<p>When words can only tell so much. When the feels take over. The heart races into a calm. The rough tides meet the tranquil. The transient yet eternal fractals of life shawn the orgasms of chaste spasms. It is the sentient presence of the friend spirit that pacifies the Pacific. A true silence is born, potent with eternity itself.</p>

<p>I am sure I know of this silence.
I am sure I have one.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for curing me.</p>

<p>Thank you being here.</p>

<hr />

<p>In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson issued the first presidential proclamation honoring fathers, designating the third Sunday in June as Father’s Day.</p>

<p>That third Sunday this year is today. June 19 2016.</p>

<p><em>Roses.</em> I woke up and saw roses. Roses in my garden. White and red.</p>

<p><em>Birds.</em> I saw birds flying in the sky. Free. Honoring their liberation.</p>

<p><em>Mongoose.</em> I saw a chain of mongeese swiftly crossing the road, the little ones, tail to tail. Love and care.</p>

<p><em>Ants.</em> I saw them working hard for their hill. For life.</p>

<p><em>Cats.</em> I saw a cat, majestic and calmly licking it’s paw.</p>

<p>Then, I saw my <em>father</em>. Drinking coffee. <br />
Déjà vu hit me. 
My father was all of the thoughts that clouded my mind this morning while I was at the garden.</p>

<p>Our relation is different. Silent and powerful. Calm and free. Caring and discipline. We don’t hang out a lot. 
Our taste in movies is different.
Our taste in songs is different. 
Our taste in some routine life is different.</p>

<p>But in a good way.</p>

<p>My father is pure and powerful in his heart as the roses. He sees me as his bird as I’m let free to do anything. He is caring and loving in his own way which is different but as I told you, in a good way. He works hard like an ant, and though doesn’t spend much time with me, he is always present when I need him. He pivots my life when it goes astray. He is calm and very understanding and respects many ideas that I give around the dinner table.</p>

<p>This journey of father and son is an unique one. It’s the slash of red grapes and the juice of emotions. It’s tenderly strong. He is the bright sunlight that shines in my gloomy mind. He silent, but strong. He is watching me, every step that I tread my weary path. The flowers bloom in my road are watered by him.</p>

<p>He is my dark knight. <br />
He is Batman.</p>

<p><strong>Happy Fathers Day Dad!.</strong></p>

<p>I love him for being what he was, what he is and what he will be.</p>

<p>Oh boy, I would like to take him surfing some day, or maybe sit and talk with some cheese, grapes and a jug of wine?</p>

        <p><strong>12:15 am</strong> :</p>

<p>It’s midnight. <br />
I am on Quora. As usual. <br />
My mother comes to my room, and sits beside me. <br />
This conversation starts.</p>

<p><strong>Mom</strong> : When will go to sleep? <br />
<strong>Me</strong> : Just after a minute. <br />
<strong>Mom</strong> : Really? <br />
<strong>Me</strong> : Yes, don’t worry, you go to sleep, I will sleep now. <br />
<strong>Mom</strong> : Then,  go and brush now. <br />
<strong>Me</strong> : Yes, I  will. <br />
<strong>Mom</strong> : Let me sit here till you come back from brushing. <br />
<strong>Me</strong> : I will go, please go and sleep. <br />
<strong>Mom</strong> : No, I will wait till I see you asleep. <br />
<strong>Me</strong> : Mom, I just figured I have to watch the new episode of Arrow.
I will be sleeping late, Mom. Around 1 am, so go and sleep. <br />
<strong>Mom</strong> : When will you take care of yourself? Okay. Sleep before 1am. <br />
<strong>Me</strong> : Yes, Mom definitely.</p>

<p>She goes to her room. All lights are off of the house except mine. After brushing, I start watching Arrow. ( <em>only one episode as promised to my Mother.</em>) <br />
It’s almost 1 am.</p>

<p><strong>1:45 am</strong> :</p>

<p>Finish watching an episode of Arrow. As the suspense is unbearable,  I watch another episode of Arrow.</p>

<p><strong>2:30 am</strong> :</p>

<p>Finish watching another episode. (<em>Sorry for the lie, mom</em>) <br />
<strong>It’s 2:30 am.</strong> <br />
My mother walks in, again. <br />
Conversation follows.</p>

<p><strong>Mom</strong> : What time is it now! <br />
<strong>Me</strong> : Err,… Umm. I don’t know. <br />
<strong>Mom</strong> : 2:30 am! You told me you will sleep before 1 am!!!. <br />
<strong>Me</strong> : I’m hungry, mom. <br />
<strong>Mom</strong>: I had told you to take one more roti. <br />
<strong>Me</strong>(<em>thinking</em>) : I get it now <br />
<strong>Mom</strong> : Wait, let me go and  heat milk.</p>

<p>Goes to <strong>heat milk at 2:30 am for me, after a tiring and hard day.</strong> <br />
Comes back with warm milk and some biscuits. :)</p>

<p>I greedily eat while she pats me and advises me to sleep early and eat properly. <br />
I goof and joke around. <br />
<strong>She</strong> <em>laughs.</em> <br />
I do, too.</p>

<p><strong>She says</strong> : “Always keep laughing irrespective you study, or do anything. I will be happy.”</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong> (<em>internally tears forming, and loving her more.</em>) : Yes Mom, you too keep laughing, always.</p>

<p>It’s <strong>3 am</strong> in the morning. <br />
I go to sleep and she goes too. <br />
All lights are off. <br />
It’s dark.</p>

<p><strong>3:15 am</strong> :</p>

<p>I am still awake, on my bed. <br />
<em>Insomnia, perhaps.</em> I try to make those eyelids fall, but all effort goes in vain. <br />
I start reading Quora. ;).</p>

<p><strong>3:45 am</strong> :</p>

<p>Suddenly, I hear her footsteps, for her feet wears those <em>pretty leg-ankle jewelry-chain</em>. <br />
( I don’t know what the word is, and I’m too lazy now to search it up).</p>

<p>I suddenly close my phone, face the screen down and play to be asleep.</p>

<p>My mother enters my room. She checks if I’m sleeping.</p>

<p>Covers my cold feet with the blanket. <br />
Caresses my hair, kisses me on the forehead, and says good night.</p>

<p><strong>It’s 4 am.</strong></p>

<p>I will probably wake up late, at <strong>11 am</strong>, but she <strong>has to wake up at 7 am</strong> for her work calls, which will, again be for me.</p>

<p>She <em>slept only</em> after she checked if I slept. <br />
She <strong>stayed almost the whole night awake</strong>, just for me. <br />
Indian Moms are so awesome and amazing, isn’t?</p>

<p><em>She loves me dearly. And…</em> <br />
<em>And, such is mother’s love.</em></p>

<p><strong>4:15 am</strong> :</p>

<p>I, totally amazed by a mother’s love, keep thinking about hope and love that makes the world such a beautiful place. It doesn’t matter where the hell we are, how old we are and how bad our situation is. <br />
<strong>Mother’s love is always, always there for you.</strong> <br />
<strong>You are still in the womb of her love.</strong> <br />
<strong>Sacrifice is immense, and so is her tender, gentle and genuine love.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I love you, mom.</strong></p>

<p><strong>4:20 am</strong></p>

<p>I start writing this on Quora. <br />
