        <p>The end syllable “coin” had struck a considerable interest in the bridegrooms, fat and near bald father.</p>

<p>As he pursed his lips and rose his spectacle just up to look into his phone about Bitcoin…</p>

<p>…it hit him hard.</p>

<p>He was about to get rich, he dreamt, he drooled. He thought of all the scented toilet paper he could buy, the white gold for his missus and a majestic flat for the family….</p>

<p>…and soon found out the call he was in, had gone silent.</p>

<p>He wouldn’t allow this opportunity to pass like his playful habits of passing gas in crowds…</p>

<p>…fat thumbs which had committed sins because of greed, gluttony and lust, began furiously dialing the numbers of the Bitcoin bride…</p>

<p>…the reply he got was an eerie, static line at the other end, he dialed again and again and with passing time, a chill ran through his senile spine..</p>

<p>..through the window he could see the near frozen haze of the evening as the sun went down…it was cold but he was sweating hard….</p>

<p>..finally the static gave away to his misery and he heard a woman’s voice..</p>

<p>…“hello?”, said the calm female voice, “I missed you so much!”… his eyes bulged, the very same mouth which acted like a sword, many times, had lost it’s voice..</p>

<p>…a feeble gasp accompanied by horror escaped that vile mouth which made the tobacco soaked teeth clearly visible..</p>

<p>“I missed you so much! papa!”</p>

<p>Right in the wall, up the corded phone, hung the picture of this daughter – his dead daughter decorated by flowers and respected by the pious paste of sandalwood.</p>
